# Kubernetes Web Services Infrastructure

This repository outlines the infrastructure and deployment process for hosting web services on a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon EKS. The web services expose a public API to an existing internal system, while ensuring secure communication with the internal systems and automated code deployment.

## Infrastructure Overview

The infrastructure consists of the following key components:

- **Amazon EKS**: Managed Kubernetes service to host the web services.
- **Amazon VPC**: Virtual network setup to ensure isolated, secure communication between the EKS cluster and internal systems.
- **Load Balancer**: AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) to expose web services to the public internet.
- **Ingress Controller**: NGINX Ingress Controller to manage incoming traffic to Kubernetes services.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring service to track the health and connectivity of the web services and alert the support team.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: CI/CD pipeline for automated code deployment to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Setup Guide

### 1. **Amazon EKS Cluster Setup**

- Create an **EKS Cluster** in a private subnet within an **Amazon VPC**.
- Use the EKS Managed Node Groups to scale the Kubernetes worker nodes.
- Configure **VPC Peering** between the EKS VPC and the internal-assets VPC for secure communication.

### 2. **Secure Communication with Internal Systems**

- Set up **VPC Peering** to enable secure private communication between the EKS cluster and the "internal-assets" VPC.
- If required, configure **AWS PrivateLink** to access internal AWS services securely.
- Implement **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs** to restrict access to the internal network.

### 3. **Web Services Deployment**

- Use **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** to expose web services to the public internet.
- Deploy **NGINX Ingress Controller** for routing incoming HTTP(S) traffic to the services inside the Kubernetes cluster.
- Use **AWS ACM (Certificate Manager)** to manage **TLS certificates** for secure communication.

### 4. **Monitoring and Alerts**

- Set up **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring the health of the web services and their connectivity to the internal systems.
- Integrate **AWS SNS** for automatic notifications to the support team in case of connectivity issues.
- Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for detailed monitoring and alerting within the Kubernetes cluster.

### 5. **Automated Code Deployment**

- Set up a **CI/CD pipeline** using **AWS CodePipeline** or **Jenkins** to automatically deploy changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
- Utilize **Helm** for simplifying Kubernetes deployments and managing application configurations.

## Security Considerations

- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Define and assign IAM roles to control access to the EKS cluster and internal resources.
- **Kubernetes Network Policies**: Implement network policies within the Kubernetes cluster to restrict communication between pods.
- **Secrets Management**: Use **AWS Secrets Manager** or **Kubernetes Secrets** to securely manage sensitive data like API keys and credentials.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connectivity Issues**: Check the logs in **CloudWatch** for any errors or alerts related to connectivity between the EKS cluster and the internal systems.
- **Deployment Failures**: Review the **AWS CodePipeline** logs and check the **Helm** deployment status for errors.

## Conclusion

This setup ensures secure, scalable, and automated deployment of web services on Kubernetes using Amazon EKS, while maintaining secure communication with internal systems and ensuring operational monitoring and alerting.
